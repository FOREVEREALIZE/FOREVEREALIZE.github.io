description: Day 1 of my Christmas!
---

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my Christmas.

Yes! I'm finally getting around to this! On this series of 4 blog posts I'll be explaining what I did this Christmas! I know, original, right? Okay anyways, today I had to wake up pretty early, because I'll be spending a couple of days in France. Oui oui, very fancy, I know. When we first crossed the border from Spain (where I live), we were greeted by a RAINBOW. I KNOW, SO COOL.

I got to Leucate at around 14:30, and ate lunch there at a restaurant called [Les Orange de la Mer](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QGfYHmb2p3o4pENB6). They have some AMAZING seafood platters for really cheap.

After that, I headed for my hotel in Le Barcarè. I'm staying at [The Relax Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WuGkeDVxLZSkSHLo8). Not suuuuper fancy, but it's quite cosy, plus they have a Spa (look out for Day 2!). However, it was very very windy! According to [weatherunderground.com](https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/LFMP/date/2024-12-22), winds of up to 48 km/h from W and up to 88 km/h overall. It was also super cold: Even though it was around 10ºC, the sensation, at least according to Apple, was 1ºC! (Even though the screenshot is from Narbonne, the situation in Le Barcarè was basically the same)

After relaxing for a little bit in the hotel, I decided to go to Narbonne's Christmas Market. It was windy, but not as much. It was full of lights and food stalls but, surprisingly, in spite of all the flashy attractions, it was very seizure-firendly. I had a stroll around and looked for somewhere to have dinner but, for some reason, I couldn't find anywhere where they made French food. It was all italian food (especially pizza) and kebab shops.

And then, all of a sudden, it started just **POURING** rain. I had to leave in a bit of a rush and, as I was driving away, the glowing letters "KFC" called me. I ended up eating there and, to finish off the day, I went back to the hotel to prepare for Day 2, where I will be visiting the Barcarè Village de Noël (spoiler: I _won't_ visit it, stay tuned for tomorrow's post).
